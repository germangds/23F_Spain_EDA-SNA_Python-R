# 23F_Spain_EDA-SNA_Python-R
In this SNA project, we thought that it would be a great idea to conduct an NLP tweets text analysis regarding the 23F in Spain. The 23rd of February of 1981 also known as 23-F or the “Tejerazo” was an attempt of coupd’etat performed by Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero and 200 armed Civil Guard officers who broke into the Congress of Deputies during the vote to elect a President of the Government.Tejero and his officers held hostage during 18 hours the parliamentarians and minister'shostage for 18 hours. The King Juan Carlos I addressed the nation in a televised speech in which he denounced the coup and called for rule of law and the democracy to continue.Tejero surrendered the next morning and set free the hostages. During the following years, several conspiracy theories have developed around this event, and to date there is still debate of what really happened on that day. As a result, and due to the current political discontent, it was expected that Spaniards would use social media to express their opinions about such date. We were able to analyze over 31K tweets in a timespan of 2 days and utilize python (EDA (Sentiment Analysis)) and R (Bigrams, Skipgrams, Community Detection (Louvain method) and Phi Correlation).
